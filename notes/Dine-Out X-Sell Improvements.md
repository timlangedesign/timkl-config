# 1. Food -> Dine-Out

## Feedback

*Simple fade of the brand logos does the job of showing the different brands.*
**Action:** Use Duxton card with a bg color + fade between the brand logos.

*Messaging could be sharper **Get 20% Off Total Bill** instead of **Dine-Out and save big**.*
**Action:** Work with @daniel.loy to craft the content.

*Missing a clear connection to the Dine-Out landing page.*
**Action:** Align content between Food In-Transit and Dine-Out Landing Page.

*Missing transition continuity between Food In-Transit to Dine-Out landing page.* (aspirational)
**Action:** Animate the elements gracefully between the two different views.

# 2. Transport > Dine-Out

*Unclear connection between pins and carousel, have to do a lot of mental book-keeping to understand the view.*
*No clear headline, what is this all about?*
*In general a lot of information to keep track of in a single view.*
**Action:** Alternative approach without carousel, add headline + cycle through the merchants.

Probe on this structure:
- What's the purpose of the Big Brand card?
- What about the events in carousel.
- What about Deals | Shops vs Deals | Events | Updates.

**Check-in at store**
Imagine that you've had your nails done at the Nail Artistry? (change the narrative for the man)
You had a good experience and you want to give a good review to this business. Go ahead!
Probe towards check-in/scan receipt.
- What does it mean to check-in?
- What does it mean to scan receipt?
- Why would scan your receipt here?
- What do you think the purpose is for scanning your receipt?

Imagine that you open the Grab app again - and this what you see?
What has changed?
Probe towards the categories.
- How do you feel about these categories?
- Can you imagine any other categories here?

What do you think you'll see after you tap on these category cards?
Is this what you expected?

I'm having a meeting in 90 mins with an organisation for PWDs in Singapore, SGEnable.
I need some guidance on how to conduct this meeting.
My company is Grab a ride-sharing, food delivery etc app.
I'm thinking to structure the meeting like this:

Purpose:
We want to map the gaps in the current experience

Measures:
Survey
Fundamental research, interviews
[Other?]

[Help me out with other points]

Email from me to SGEnable

In this meeting, we are eager to tap into SGEnable's insights to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by Persons with Disabilities when interacting with Grab.  
  
We are excited to brainstorm and discuss potential collaborations, such as surveys or workshops, to identify these challenges and enhance our services.  
  
We have a few ideas that we are keen to share and get your thoughts on.

Hi Patrick and Grab Team%% 
 %%,

It was a pleasure to have the introductory meeting! We believe that this accessibility project will be very impactful for PVIs and would like to support the development of this project wherever possible. I would like to introduce our division’s new Deputy Director, Sally, in this conversation to keep her up-to-date on the latest developments on this project.

As a follow-up, could the Grab Team provide a few dates from our next meeting?

A list of actionable items as per our previous discussion:

1. Grab:

1. Provide specific use cases of the final product. Specifically, which functions will Grab be focusing on? (i.e. Ride hailing, Grab Food)

3. SG Enable:

1. Recruit PVIs to conduct User Testing
2. Explore the potential of long term advisory and support for the development of the product

Best,

Orion

Hi Orion,

Thank you for sharing this with your colleagues and being open to Grab’s project!

On the meeting you are setting up, will it be to discuss this? Let me know.

Looping in Patrick Jean, Head of Design at Grab into this thread, and helping to share his quick fire answers to your questions:

1.                   Is the purpose of this collaboration focused on enhancing the on-screen navigation of the app interface, or to enhance their overall user journey from location A to location B?  
⁠Ideally it would be both, there is the App experience, but then there is also the service design part on getting from A to B. Which obviously is really tricky, but a core part of the experience.

2.                   We have a few entities in mind who might want to work on this, can I ask which SSA (Social Service Agency) is Grab currently working with? And how many more Persons with Visual Impairments will they be looking at?  
We are not working with any SSA as of now, and it is less about the # of people, but more being able to establish a cadence and a point of contact to get input on improvements or directional feedback on what we are working on.

3.                   Would SG Enable be involved in the development of this project at all, or would Grab only require inputs from the PVIs?  
Inputs only, unless they had something specific in mind. We do not expect funding or support in any kind.

4.                   What is the intended outcome for this project? Is it a research collaboration, pilot, or does Grab intent to introduce this as a feature to their platform?

⁠We tend to continuously improve our App experiences and ship better solutions. So this is more about getting more ground truth into our product and ensure we deliver great products.

_Best,_

_Jeanette_

Guidance from Research Ops:
- Conducting due diligence and maintaining tactful engagement are crucial when collaborating with nonprofit organizations. An intermediary is necessary for recruiting individuals and managing finances, and it's essential to establish clear 'rules of engagement' for these collaborations.
- Formalizing partnerships with nonprofit organizations is vital to prevent misunderstandings. This process should emphasize transparency, mutual benefits, and the importance of clear and cautious communication to avoid potential issues.
- Collaborating with diverse communities such as SGEnable / SAVJ is beneficial as it ensures a diverse panel, reducing bias that may arise from sourcing insights from the same group repeatedly. However, clear guidelines must be established before working with nonprofit organizations. These guidelines should outline the roles and responsibilities of different teams within the organization and involve individuals with experience in ESG work. Therefore, involvement of internal communication, PR, and Social Impact teams is necessary for these initiatives.

**Next AI:**  

- Tim to draft a document outlining guidelines for engaging with nonprofits and collaborating on accessibility initiatives.
- Aspiah to identify and connect with key personnel in Grab (e.g., Janvier, Iris/Irene) who have experience with ESG initiatives and nonprofit collaborations.
- Our efforts to collaborate with MOT in order to engage the elderly population in Singapore for our research are ongoing

Do let me know if there's any follow up questions or things that are missing in this summary.

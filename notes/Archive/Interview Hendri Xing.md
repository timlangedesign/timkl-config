Chose Google Maps because he use it on a daily basis.
Use it to track his bus. Public transport.
[Asked us questions, good interactive way of presenting]
"Do you need the map?"
Good question, but maybe zoomed in to far too early? Would like some product/business perspective.
"Contrast ratio of buttons are out of whack."
Overly focused on visual design. 
Good points on the visual design though.
- Shortcuts in front of filters doesn't scale.
Would reduce the amount of map screen real estate.
Seperating the filters is key.
Missing some strategic, product thinking - too focused on the visual design.
Public Transport feature
- Would prefer relative time
Presentation style lacks some annotation, some visual aids.
Doesn't mention research validating design decisions.
Good insights on Public Transport maps experience:
- Zoom in on the relevant step in journey
Some service design thinking, thinks about the actual physical experience
Considers push notifications
Would design a unique vibration, considers haptics.
Overall:
Good grasp on interaction design
Missing strategic, product thinking - a deeper reason why he chose Google Maps, where can he see some more deep challenges / opportunities.
Presentation style was a bit messy, missing some structure.
Some service design thinking
Some good thinking about progressive disclosure
All in all, I'm No for G5.

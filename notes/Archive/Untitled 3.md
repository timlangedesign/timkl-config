Collaboration Opportunities

• **Research and User Testing**: Discuss how Grab and SGEnable could collaborate on:

• Conducting **surveys** or **interviews** to better understand user pain points.

• **Workshops**: Explore holding co-creation workshops with PWDs, PVIs, and Grab’s design team to brainstorm and prototype accessibility features.

  

**4. Long-term Collaboration**

  

• **Support and Advisory**: Discuss SGEnable’s potential role in providing ongoing feedback and guidance, possibly through an advisory group or steering committee.

• **Partnership Scope**: Formalize the discussion around the nature of this collaboration—whether it is research-driven, product-focused, or a continuous accessibility improvement project.

  

**5. Actionable Next Steps**

  

• **Specific Use Cases**: Share the Grab team’s focus areas (e.g., ride-hailing, Grab Food, etc.) and seek feedback from SGEnable.

• **Recruitment and Testing**: Finalize SGEnable’s role in recruiting PWDs for user testing and the cadence for feedback loops.

• **Follow-Up Meetings**: Discuss timelines for future meetings and milestones.

  

**Other Considerations:**

  

• **Surveys and Interviews**: Consider expanding research to include caregivers or family members of PWDs, as they may offer additional insights on challenges faced.

• **Additional Research Tools**: Discuss incorporating accessibility audits (evaluating existing Grab features) or competitor benchmarking to compare how other services handle PWD accessibility.

• **Legal and Compliance Aspects**: Make sure to touch on any guidelines or compliance requirements for accessibility in Singapore that SGEnable can advise on.

	Fear vs. opportunity

**AI won’t replace designers—but it will change what we work on.**  
Instead of spending time on mundane tasks, we can **push our craft forward** and focus on **higher-level creative challenges**.  

AI handles the groundwork, freeing us to **experiment, refine, and innovate** in ways we never could before.

# An example, illustration creation
1. **AI speeds up production:** Routine tasks like **illustration generation, asset cleanup, and layout adjustments** can be automated.  
2. **More time for movement & expression:** Designers can focus on **animation, interactions, and micro-movements that bring interfaces to life**.  

**Bringing interfaces to life:**  
Instead of creating base illustrations, we focus on **how they move, react, and feel**.  

**Rive & real-time animation:**  
New tools like **Rive** let designers **animate directly, without engineering bottlenecks**.
